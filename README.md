# *Computer Vision - Car Park Counter with OpenCV*

In this project, we count the number of cars in a car parking, This project can be generalized to any project where we want to count the number of occurance of objects/inventory.
If the car is parked in the parking, then the spot will be highlighted in red box if the parking is free, then the spot will be highlighted in green.

We used OpenCV to count the number of free spaces in the car parking.
